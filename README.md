## 🌟 What You'll Learn

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) & ReAct
Explore how RAG combines the power of retrieval with generative AI, enabling models to access and synthesize external knowledge. Discover ReAct techniques that blend reasoning and action, pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve in information-rich environments.

### 2. LLM Agents
Uncover the capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents. Learn how these agents can perform complex tasks, interact naturally with users, and orchestrate workflows—making AI more practical and impactful.

### 3. Agentic RAG
See how agentic behavior supercharges RAG! Experience autonomous decision-making paired with advanced retrieval, empowering AI to solve problems with greater effectiveness and adaptability.

### 4. Multi-Agent Systems
Step into the world of distributed intelligence. Watch multiple agents collaborate, learn, and tackle challenges together—demonstrating the future of scalable, collective AI architectures.
